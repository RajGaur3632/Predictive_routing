# Emergency Routing System

## Overview

The Emergency Routing System is a web-based application designed to provide optimal routing for emergency services in Bangalore, India. This project utilizes OpenStreetMap (OSM) data to model the road network and incorporates real-time traffic data to enhance route efficiency. The system aims to facilitate faster response times for emergency services, improving overall public safety.
